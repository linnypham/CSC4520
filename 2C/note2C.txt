recursion: the function calls itself until it reaches the base case (memory-intensive)(easier to read)
iteration: the program executes a loop until a condition is met (less memory)(complex )
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
Recursive function must always have at least
one Base Case and one Recursive Case
