algorithm: 
    well-defined computational procedure that takes 
    some value, or set of values, as input and produces 
    some value, or set of values, as output in 
    a finite amount of time.
Theoretical importance: The code of computer science
Pratical imporcance: 
    A practictioner's tool kit mof know algorithms
    Framework for designing and analyzing algorithm for new problems

Time efficiency is measured by counting the number of times the algorithmâ€™s basic operation is executed
Space efficiency is measured by counting the number of extra memory units consumed by the algorithm

Analyzing algorithms : 
    predicting the resources that the algotism requires
        Memory
        Communicaiton bandwith
        Energy consumption
